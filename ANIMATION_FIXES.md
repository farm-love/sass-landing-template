# ✅ ANIMATION FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS

## 🎯 ISSUES FIXED

- ✅ **Headline** - Now fades in and slides up (delay: 0.2s)
- ✅ **Subtitle** - Fades in and slides up (delay: 0.4s)
- ✅ **CTA Buttons** - Animated entrance (delay: 0.6s)
- ✅ **Social Proof** - Smooth fade-in (delay: 0.8s)

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Changed `w-18 h-18 p-4` → `w-16 h-16`
- ✅ Added fade-in animations to each card
- ✅ Cards now animate in sequence (staggered delay)
- ✅ Proper icon sizing for small and large cards

**Result:** No more empty spaces, perfect card layouts!

**Problem:** Feature cards appeared instantly without animation

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `motion.div` wrapper to each card
- ✅ Initial state: `opacity: 0, y: 20, scale: 0.95`
- ✅ Animated state: `opacity: 1, y: 0, scale: 1`
- ✅ Staggered delays: `index * 0.1s`
- ✅ Works with TiltCard 3D effect

**Result:** Smooth, professional card entrance animations!
